Astra: The Centrifugal Frontier
Astra: The Centrifugal Frontier is a visionary space-survival simulation that reimagines the relationship between orbital mechanics and societal evolution. From a high-tech First-Person Cockpit, you oversee a realistic, multi-layered Earth whose survival is tied to a physical paradox: the faster your home planet spins, the further your satellite worlds are pushed into the stars via centrifugal force. In this universe, pushing planets into the outer reaches is the ultimate win condition, signaling a civilization that has mastered its own kinetic energy.

The gameplay is a strategic dance of spatial precision. Using a Tactical Map, you deploy planets that you have hand-painted on a digital canvas. Space is unforgiving; you are strictly prohibited from placing a planet where one already exists. As your civilization matures, the difficulty spikes: the Safe Deployment Zone constricts, shrinking inward toward Earth. You must manage an increasingly crowded inner system while struggling to push existing worlds outward.

The heart of Astra lies in its Generative AI Game Master. Every deployment triggers a tricky, thematic dilemma from a timeline of your choice—be it Cyberpunk, Cosmic Horror, or Ancient Mythology. The AI invents original, morally grey scenarios where your choices directly influence Earth’s spin. A wise decision accelerates rotation, soaring your planets into higher orbits, while a reckless choice slows the spin, causing your empire to contract and lose momentum.

To win, you must navigate these AI-driven crises to reach Critical Rotation. If you can successfully pack your satellites into the shrinking placement zones and maintain the high-speed spin required to push them to the system’s edge, you will achieve Interstellar Equilibrium, securing your civilization’s place among the stars forever.
